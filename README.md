# Design Tokens

> An opinionated design token structure, powering Magic as a Service’s [Design System](https://github.com/magicasaservice/design-system)

## 💡 Intention

This repository is intended to power our own design system as well as serve as a blueprint for all future design system projects.

## 🚧 Construction

Our design tokens are structured in three hierachical layers:

1. `Config`
2. `Application`
3. `Components`

The specificity of each layer topples the one prior. Tokens from each layer can either reference the layer below or include a finite value.

```
         __________
        /          \
       / components \
      /______________\
     /                \
    /    application   \
   /____________________\
  /                      \
 /         config         \
/__________________________\
```

## ✨ Customization

To customize the design tokens, each of the layers’ tokens can be overwritten within a layer injected directly above it into the hierachical structure. This is intended for features such as adusted mobile styles or dark mode.

```
            _________
           /         \
          / component \
         /_____________\
        /               \
       /      dark       \
      /___________________\
     /                     \
    /      application      \
   /_________________________\
  /                           \
 /           config            \
/_______________________________\
```

## 🖇️ Structure

Each layer of tokens fulfills a different function. Therefore, adding, removing or refactoring tokens should be done in consideration of the respective layer’s purpose.

### application

### component

## 🧰 Tooling

The design token structure is currently built with [Tokens Studio](https://tokens.studio/) in Figma. The tokens than act as a source for a custom compiler within our [Design System](https://github.com/magicasaservice/design-system), built with [Style Dictionary](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary).
