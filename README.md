# Design Tokens

> An opinionated design token structure, powering Magic as a Service‚Äôs [Design System](https://github.com/magicasaservice/design-system)

## üí° Intention

This repository is intended to power our own design system as well as serve as a blueprint for all future design system projects.

## üöß Construction

Our design tokens are structured in three hierachical layers:

1. `Config`
2. `Application`
3. `Components`

The specificity of each layer topples the one prior. Tokens from each layer can either reference the layer below or include a finite value.

```
         __________
        /          \
       / components \
      /______________\
     /                \
    /    application   \
   /____________________\
  /                      \
 /         config         \
/__________________________\
```

## ‚ú® Customization

To customize the design tokens, each of the layers‚Äô tokens can be overwritten within a layer injected directly above it into the hierachical structure. This is intended for features such as adusted mobile styles or dark mode.

```
            ___________
           /           \
          /  component  \
         /_______________\
        /                 \
       / application--dark \
      /_____________________\
     /                       \
    /       application       \
   /___________________________\
  /                             \
 /            config             \
/_________________________________\
```

## üß∞ Tooling

The design token structure is currently built with [Tokens Studio](https://tokens.studio/) in Figma. The tokens than act as a source for a custom compiler within our [Design System](https://github.com/magicasaservice/design-system), built with [Style Dictionary](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary).
